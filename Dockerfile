# The following snippet is essentially the same as the upstream dockerfile
# here: https://github.com/snapcore/snapcraft/blob/master/docker/stable.Dockerfile
# except we also specify the architecture to download so that this works
# on other architectures like arm64, etc.
# Basically, we send a command to the snap store for the info on the core +
# snapcraft snaps, extract the download link from the JSON result and then 
# download and extract the snaps into the docker container.
# We do this because we can't easily run snapd (and thus snaps) inside a 
# docker container without disabling important security protections enabled 
# for docker containers.
# TODO: add a little bit of error checking for the curl calls in case we ever
# are on a proxy or something and we end up downloading a login page or
# or something like that

# The upstream dockerfile just uses this file locally from the repo since it's
# in the same build context, but rather than copy that file here into the 
# build context before running, we can just download it from github directly
# While unlikely, it is possible that the file location could move in the 
# upstream git repo on the master branch, so for stability in our builds, just
# hard-code the git commit that most recently updated this file as the 
# revision to download from.
# Note: If this script ever breaks with the version of snapcraft we downloaded
# above, try updating this Dockerfile to do same as whatever the upstream
# docker image does
